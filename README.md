# machine-learning-journey-log
Log of the important concepts, exercises, thoughts throughout my ML learning journey

This includes: 
- Notes and mathematical concepts I have learnt
- Code of the models I have trained

## File Descriptions 

model-training: 
this file contains code for model training for different project topics and competitions. each project or competition folder contains experimental models where I experiment with preprocessing steps, model type and model hyperparameters as well as finalised models 

theory-notes: 
this file contains notes of the mathematics behind various machine learning concepts, foundational concepts as well as notes or analogies that I have written so I can intuitively understand the models better
